## What I'm Expecting/Hypothesis

Over the years I have taught myself to touch type using the [QWERTY]() keyboard layout and if memory serves, my maximum recorded speed was around 60 [WPM]('' Words Per Minute). A year or two ago I wanted to improve my effeciency when typing as I spend around 12+ hours at my keyboard and started exploring alternative keyboard layouts and decided to give [Colemak]() a try. Maybe the time wasn't right or I wasn't able to spend enough time acquiring the new skill, but it never stuck.

I turned back to [QWERTY]() somewhat dejected. A few months ago the bug bit again and I decided to give the [Dvorak]() layout a go. At the time I was starting a new job and decided that I would go cold-turkey and hit it at 100% as my onboarding was quite gentle. This dedicated time seemed to do the trick and as of today, I am touch typing in [Dvorak]() at around 60 [WPM]().

What spurred newest typing speed improvements was coming across a "chorded" keyboard and being reminded at how fast one can "type" on a [steno machine]() which uses this same "chording" technique. While this is something I definitely want to explore and try, it feels like the learning curve is relatively higher than just improving my conventional typing speed.

Enter the current experiment - see how much I can improve my touch typing speed in [Dvorak]() in 4 weeks of daily, measureable XXX.

## Research

## Method

The idea is to practice 10 minute each day for 4 weeks with two different tools. My baseline speed measurements in [WPM]('' Words Per Minute) for both a 1 and 3 minute test on [Typing.com](typing.com) will be recorded at commencement and the end of each week (7 days) in order to track progress.

**Baseline Measurements**:
- Lily58 Pro 1min test: x WPM
- Lily58 Pro 3min test: x WPM
- Macbook Pro 16" 1min test: x WPM
- Macbook Pro 16" 3min test: x WPM
- System76 Lemur 1min test: x WPM
- System76 Lemur 3min test: x WPM
**Commencement**: 19/01/2022
**Duration**: 4 weeks

## Variables

Something to mention is that I use 3 different keyboards in my day-to-day, namely:
- a custom-built [Lily58 Pro]() which I use the bulk of the time
- the built-in keyboard on my Macbook Pro 16" 2019
- and the built-in keyboard on my personal System76 Lemur 10

That said, I will only be specifically practicing on the Lily, but I will be monitoring how this practice translates into speed improvements on the other 2 keyboards.

**Final measurements**:
- Lily58 Pro 1min test: ? WPM
- Lily58 Pro 3min test: ? WPM
- Macbook Pro 16" 1min test: ? WPM
- Macbook Pro 16" 3min test: ? WPM
- System76 Lemur 1min test: ? WPM
- System76 Lemur 3min test: ? WPM
