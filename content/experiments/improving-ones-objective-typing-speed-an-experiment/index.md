## Introduction

Over the years I have taught myself to touch type using the [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") keyboard layout and if memory serves, my maximum recorded speed was around 60 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute"). A year or two ago I wanted to improve my efficiency when typing as I spend around 12+ hours at my keyboard and started exploring alternative keyboard layouts. I decided to give [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak "Colemak") a try. Maybe the time wasn't right or I wasn't able to spend enough time acquiring the new skill, but it never stuck.

I turned back to [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") somewhat dejected. A few months ago the bug bit again and I decided to give the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") layout a go. At the time I was starting a new job and decided that I would go cold-turkey and hit it at 100% as my on-boarding was quite gentle. This dedicated time seemed to do the trick and as of today, I am touch typing in [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") at around 60 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute").

What spurred the latest desire to improve my typing speed was coming across a "chorded" keyboard and being reminded at how fast one can "type" on a [steno machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype) which uses this same "chording" technique. While this is something I definitely want to explore and try, it feels like the learning curve is relatively higher than just improving my conventional typing speed.

Enter the current experiment - see how much I can improve my touch typing speed in [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") in 4 weeks of daily, consistent, measurable practice.

## What I'm Expecting/Hypothesis

I'm expecting my typing speed on [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") to improve by at least 20 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute").

## Method

The idea is to practice 10 minute each day for 4 weeks with two different online tools. My baseline speed measurements in [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute") for a 1 minute test on [Typing.com](https://typing.com) will be recorded the day before commencement and the at end of each week (7 days) in order to track progress.

The daily 10 minute practice will be split into 2 equal sessions, 5 minutes on [Typing.com](https://typing.com) and 5 minutes on [Keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/).

**Commencement**: 21/01/2022  
**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Baseline Measurements**:

## Variables

### Multiple Keyboards = Different Results

Something to mention is that I use 3 different keyboards in my day-to-day, namely:
- a custom-built [Lily58 Pro](https://keyn.co.za/product/lily58pro/) which I use the bulk of the time
- the built-in keyboard on my [Macbook Pro 16" 2019](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP809?locale=en_US)
- and the built-in keyboard on my personal [System76 Lemur Pro 10](https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/lemp10/README.html)

That said, I will only be specifically practicing on the Lily, but I will be monitoring how this practice translates into speed improvements on the other 2 keyboards.

### Accuracy of Test Results

With regard to the test results, I will take the 3x 1 minute tests, each with a different keyboard and with a 5 minute break in-between.

## Journal

*__20/01/2022__*  
Captain's log: Taking initial measurements... I didn't sleep well with being on-call and the alerts are coming in thick and fast, but if I don't take the measurements today, the experiment will be delayed another day and I feel I may lose momentum with this whole idea :(

*__21/01/2022__*  
Captain's log: The experiment commences...

*__24/01/2022__*  
Captain's log: I wasn't able to get a training session in yesterday as there was way too much happening that kept me away from my PC. Instead, I hope that two sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, would sort of make up for the missed session.

*__29/01/2022__*  
Captain's log: Again, because of life I had to catch up some practice :( this I will do tomorrow...
