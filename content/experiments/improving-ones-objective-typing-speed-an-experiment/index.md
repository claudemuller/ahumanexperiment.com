## Introduction

Over the years I have taught myself to touch type using the [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") keyboard layout and if memory serves, my maximum recorded speed was around 60 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute"). A year or two ago I wanted to improve my effeciency when typing as I spend around 12+ hours at my keyboard and started exploring alternative keyboard layouts and decided to give [Colemak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colemak "Colemak") a try. Maybe the time wasn't right or I wasn't able to spend enough time acquiring the new skill, but it never stuck.

I turned back to [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY "QWERTY") somewhat dejected. A few months ago the bug bit again and I decided to give the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") layout a go. At the time I was starting a new job and decided that I would go cold-turkey and hit it at 100% as my onboarding was quite gentle. This dedicated time seemed to do the trick and as of today, I am touch typing in [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") at around 60 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute").

What spurred newest typing speed improvements was coming across a "chorded" keyboard and being reminded at how fast one can "type" on a [steno machine]() which uses this same "chording" technique. While this is something I definitely want to explore and try, it feels like the learning curve is relatively higher than just improving my conventional typing speed.

Enter the current experiment - see how much I can improve my touch typing speed in [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") in 4 weeks of daily, measureable XXX.

## What I'm Expecting/Hypothesis

I'm expecting my typing speed on [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout "Dvorak") to improve by at least 20 [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute").

## Research

## Method

The idea is to practice 10 minute each day for 4 weeks with two different tools. My baseline speed measurements in [WPM](/ "Words Per Minute") for both a 1 and 3 minute test on [Typing.com](typing.com) will be recorded at commencement and the end of each week (7 days) in order to track progress.

**Commencement**: 20/01/2022  
**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Baseline Measurements**:
- Lily58 Pro 1min test: x WPM
- Lily58 Pro 3min test: x WPM
- Macbook Pro 16" 1min test: x WPM
- Macbook Pro 16" 3min test: x WPM
- System76 Lemur 1min test: x WPM
- System76 Lemur 3min test: x WPM

## Variables

### Multiple Keyboards = Different Results

Something to mention is that I use 3 different keyboards in my day-to-day, namely:
- a custom-built [Lily58 Pro]() which I use the bulk of the time
- the built-in keyboard on my Macbook Pro 16" 2019
- and the built-in keyboard on my personal System76 Lemur 10

That said, I will only be specifically practicing on the Lily, but I will be monitoring how this practice translates into speed improvements on the other 2 keyboards.

### Accuracy of Test Results

With regard to the test results, I will take the 3x 1 minute tests, each with a different keyboard and with a 5 minute break away from my computer.

## Conclusion

I was able to improve my typing speed by the following for each keyboard I use:
